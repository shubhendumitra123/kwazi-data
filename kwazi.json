João Gilberto was supposed to sing this alone with Stan Getz and the band. Astrud Gilberto (who was not a well-known singer at that time) was in the studio only as a translator, because her husband Joâo did not speak English and the others at the studio (in New York City) did not speak Portuguese. For some unknown reason, Stan Getz told Astrud Gilberto to sing a little bit. Of course, he loved it, so the couple ended up singing together in the recording.﻿\n\n\nScat Man\n\"The story behind this song:  Astrud Gilberto was just the wife of singing star João Gilberto when she entered an NYC studio in March 1963. João and Jobim were making a record with tenor saxman Stan Getz. The idea of cutting a verse on “Ipanema” in English came up, and Astrud was the only one of the Brazilians who spoke more than phrasebook English.\nAstrud’s child-like vocal, devoid of vibrato and singerly mannerisms, was the perfect foil for her husband’s soft bumblebee voice. Jobim tinkled piano. Getz blew a creamy smooth tenor.

So posits The Greasy Hands Preachers, the feature documentary filmed on 16mm by director-producer team Clement Beauvais and Arthur de Kersauson, and executive produced by Orlando Bloom – a clip of which is previewed today.... Embarking on a globe-trotting trip from Utah's Bonneville Salt Flats and ending up in Central Java in Indonesia, the pair captured the philosophical spirit of bike culture and the community awakening honouring the oft-overlooked art of two-wheeled mechanics, notably devalued since the rise of American industrialism in the 1960s. \"It confirmed my intuition that, spiritually, [riding] has a lot to do with finding your place in the world not taking someone else’s,\" says de Kersauson. \"It's the only thing worth chasing in this world, along with good waves, food and women.\" ....  Their emotionally charged labour of love caught the eye of Bloom – \"a true rider\" – and honours the wildly diverse generation of bikers obsessively getting their hands dirty for the bikes and culture they inhabit. “The call for a tool to shape the world, whether it’s a wrench or a computer, is in our nature,\" says Beauvais. \"Being able to fix or create something with your hands is empowering.\".\n.\n.\n.\n.\nOriginal Post : <a href='https://www.nowness.com/story/the-greasy-hands-preachers' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>public-apis.xyz</a>"},{"title":"LSD - My Problem Child","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/kwazi/image/upload/v1558530361/Website_Assets/Inspiration/T%20Greasy%20Hand%20Preachers/AH_gmrvlm.jpg","embededUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTrtEZC39mQ","details":"The Second Time Albert Hofmann Self-experimented with LSD\n“The dizziness and sensation of fainting became so strong at times that I could no longer hold myself straight and had to lie down on a sofa. My surroundings had now transformed themselves in more terrifying ways. Everything in the room spun around, and the familiar objects and pieces of furniture assumed grotesque, threatening forms. They were in continuous motion, animated as if driven by an inner restlessness. The lady next door, whom I scarcely recognized, brought me milk—in the course of the evening, I drank more than two litres. She was no longer Mrs R., but rather a malevolent, insidious witch with a coloured mask.\n\nEven worse than these demonic transformations of the outer world, were the alterations that I perceived in myself, in my inner being. Every exertion of my will, every attempt to put an end to the disintegration of the outer world and the dissolution of my ego, seemed to be wasted effort. A demon had invaded me, had taken possession of my body, mind, and soul. I jumped up and screamed, trying to free myself from him, but then sank down again and lay helpless on the sofa. The substance, with which I had wanted to experiment, had vanquished me. It was the demon that scornfully triumphed over my will. I was seized by the dreadful fear of going insane. I was taken to another world, another place, another time. My body seemed to be without sensation, lifeless, strange. Was I dying? Was this the transition? At times I believed myself to be outside my body, and then perceived clearly, as an outside observer, the complete tragedy of my situation…\n\nBy the time the doctor arrived, the climax of my despondent condition had already passed… Slowly I came back from a weird, unfamiliar world to reassuring everyday reality. The horror softened and gave way to a feeling of good fortune and gratitude, the more normal perceptions and thoughts returned, and I became more confident that the danger of insanity was conclusively past.\n\nNow, little by little I could begin to enjoy the unprecedented colours and plays of shapes that persisted behind my closed eyes. Kaleidoscopic, fantastic images surged in on me, alternating, variegated, opening and then closing themselves in circles and spirals, exploding in coloured fountains, rearranging and hybridizing themselves in constant flux. It was particularly remarkable how every acoustic perception, such as the sound of a door handle or a passing automobile, became transformed into optical perceptions. Every sound generated a vividly changing image, with its own consistent form and colour…\n\nExhausted, I then slept, to awake next morning refreshed, with a clear head, though still somewhat tired physically. A sensation of well-being and renewed life flowed through me. Breakfast tasted delicious and gave me extraordinary pleasure. When I later walked out into the garden, in which the sun shone now after a spring rain, everything glistened and sparkled in a fresh light. The world was as if newly created. All my senses vibrated in a condition of highest sensitivity, which persisted for the entire day.”\nAlbert Hofmann, “LSD - My Problem Child” (Chapter 1)"}]}}
